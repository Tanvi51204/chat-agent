<h2>Research Topic: Capital Budgeting</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Capital budgeting is the process by which a company evaluates and selects large-scale, long-term investments. It involves identifying potential projects, assessing their profitability, and allocating funds to those that offer the highest returns, align with strategic goals, and manage risks effectively. Methods like Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period are commonly used to evaluate project feasibility and profitability.</p>
