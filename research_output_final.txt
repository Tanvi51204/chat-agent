## Research Topic: AQI (Air Quality Index)

### Summary:
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. It is primarily used in the United States but is also used in other countries. The AQI is calculated for four major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. The AQI is divided into six categories: Good (0–50), Moderate (51–100), Unhealthy for sensitive groups (101–200), Unhealthy (201–300), Very unhealthy (301–400), and Hazardous (401–500). Each category corresponds to a different level of health concern. The AQI provides a way to inform the public about air quality and associated health risks, helping individuals make decisions to protect their health.
